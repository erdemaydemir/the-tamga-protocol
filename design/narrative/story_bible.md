## The Central Mystery

### What is the Tamga Protocol?

**Tamga** (ᛏᛆᛘᚵᚨ) = Ancient Turkic runic symbols and seals used by Göktürk clans and rulers in the 6th-8th centuries CE.

**The Protocol**: A classified document from the 1990s that references these ancient symbols. The player must discover:
1. What the protocol actually is
2. Why it was created during the 1990s crisis
3. How ancient Turkic heritage connects to modern events
4. Who is behind it

**The Truth** (Revealed at game's end):
The Tamga Protocol was a contingency plan created by a secret group of historians and government officials who believed ancient Turkic knowledge contained crisis-survival wisdom. The symbols were used as a coded communication system during the economic turmoil.

**Twist**: Depending on player choices, the protocol could be:
- A benevolent preservation effort
- A conspiracy to manipulate the crisis
- A misguided attempt that made things worse
- Or something the player never fully understands
